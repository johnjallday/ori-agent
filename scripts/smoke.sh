# smoke.sh - manual checks against a running isolated demo server.
#
# Every worktree keeps its feature's smoke checks here, under this one stable
# name, so a single allowlist entry - Bash(./scripts/smoke.sh:*) - covers them
# all. Inline multi-step curl pipelines cannot be allowlisted: shell variables
# and $(...) substitution make the command unresolvable to the permission
# analyzer, so it prompts no matter how many rules exist. A script is one
# stable token. Put the shell in here, not in the tool call.
#
# This worktree's feature: Workspace Planning Workflow
# (tasks/prd-workspace-planning-policy.md).
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/smoke.sh plans <base-url> <workspace-id>
#
# Start the server it talks to with `wt demo 8931`, or by hand with the
# isolated recipe in CLAUDE.md > Smoke Testing.
#
# Exits non-zero on the first failed expectation.
